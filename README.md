Version
---
My work sometimes requires me to use old Bootstrap versions, which are not updated. Hence, I scavenged all the `less` files for v3.x. The latest at the moment is v3.3.6.

Background color
---
Defines the background color of the button.

Text color
---
Defines the text color of the button.

Class name

Assigns a custom class name, so you can smack it directly into the CSS.
